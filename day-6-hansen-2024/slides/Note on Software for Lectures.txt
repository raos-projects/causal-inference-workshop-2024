I will be using Stata in these lectures. By using Stata, I mean that I will run things in Stata but will make extensive use of Python integration in Stata and user supplied packages.

I have supplied Stata code that will produce most results in the notes. 

I have supplied R code that does similar things to the Stata code for most examples. I will not be opening or looking at the R code, but it is there for your reference and if that is the language you prefer.

If you want to run the code on your own or follow along with anything I end up doing during the lectures, you will need to have Stata set up to work with Python. Using Python with Stata requires Stata 16 or later. 

Everything was tested using scikit-learn v1.2.2 and v1.3.0. Some things may not work with previous versions of scikit-learn.

1) Getting Stata and Python setup:

https://statalasso.github.io/docs/python/

There is also useful guidance through Stata, but I find the above easy to follow and clear.

2) Getting Stata packages I will use:

net install lassopack, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statalasso/lassopack/master/") replace 
net install pdslasso, from("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/statalasso/pdslasso/master/") replace
ssc install ivreg2
ssc install ranktest
net install pystacked, from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aahrens1/pystacked/main) replace
net install ddml, from(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aahrens1/ddml/master) replace
ssc install colorscatter
ssc install rforest
ssc install coefplot
ssc install reghdfe
ssc install ftools

3) For visualizing trees, I use one Python package - graphviz - that is not part of the default Anaconda distribution. It is not terribly likely that I will run this live during the lecture. To install the package with Anaconda, 

A) Open a Python terminal window 
B) type	conda install python-graphviz 

OR

install via Anaconda Navigator

4) For trying a couple things with neural nets, I will use tensorflow and keras. To install the package with Anaconda, 

A) Open a Python terminal window
B) type pip install tensorflow

OR 

install via Anaconda Navigator

5) If things aren't working

Stata packages:

Make sure packages are there
. ado dir

If package are there, clear things out and try again:
A) Uninstall packages
. ado uninstall [xx]
where xx is the ID of the package to be uninstalled
B) Restart Stata
C) Reinstall package

Python packages:

Make sure packages are being installed into the Python environment that is linked to Stata.

I've found Python finicky and unfortunately often have to uninstall and reinstall as I update/change things.
